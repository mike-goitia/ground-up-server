## What is the Ground Up Server project?
The **Ground Up Server** project is a personal project with a goal of building a scalable backend service "from the ground up". The idiom "ground up" can also be interpreted, in this case, as making a service whole from different pieces, things that are ground up.

## Goals

[] Create CI/CD pipeline with Circle CI
[] Deploy on Elastic Beanstalk
