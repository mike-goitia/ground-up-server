Ground Up Server Project

## What is the Ground Up Server project?
The **Ground Up Server** project is a personal project with a goal of building a scalable backend service "from the ground up". The idiom "ground up" can also be interpreted, in this case, as making a service whole from different pieces, things that are ground up.

## Goals
- [ ] Create a Node + Apollo GraphQL Backend Service
- [ ] Create a MongoDb persistence layer
- [ ] Create CI/CD pipeline with Circle CI
- [ ] Deploy on Elastic Beanstalk

### Connecting Mongoose to a MongoDB
Obtain the mongoDB URI from your service and add to .env file. Never add a .env file to version control.
